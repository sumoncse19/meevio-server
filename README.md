```

### 2. Navigate to the Server Directory

```bash
cd meevio/SERVER
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 4. Create a `.env` File

Create a `.env` file in the `SERVER` folder and add the following environment variables:

```env
db_user="Original product credential here"
db_pass="Original product credential here"
jwt_Secret="Original product credential here"
HMS_TEMPLATE_ID="Original product credential here"
HMS_APP_SECRET="Original product credential here"
HMS_MANAGEMENT_TOKEN="Original product credential here"
APP_ACCESS_KEY="Original product credential here"
```

### 5. Start the Server
